pods
In Virtualization,Basic scheduling unit is VMs
In container space Basic scheduling unit is container
In kubernets space Basic scheduling unit is pod


Pod
Atomic unit of scheduling in kubernetes

Pod deployment
1.First we write a manifest file which contains the container information to API server.
2.API server and scheduler will device where to deploy these in worker nodes



Multi container pods
multi pod container are rare use case where they share name network and namespace,cgroups
More than one container/pod example supporting task to main job.



Pod networking
Every pod has unique IP address and Each container in the pod has unique port,if the pod is having multiple containers,both the container will be have difference IP address
So each container will be refereced with <POD_IP>:<container_port>
containers are exposed to outside world using the ports.


Interpod communication
flannel as the pod network plugin which is resonsible for the interpod allocation of POD IP address and pod-pod communication  

Intra pod communication
How 2 container talks to each other- using shared localhost interface

Life cyce of the pod
manifest---API server--POD(Pending)--(POD)RUNNING---POD(Successed)


Pending: pod will be downloading all the images
Running:
failed:- if things didt get happend currently from pending state ,it will move to failed state.



POD manifiest:
Container 4 top level fields

#nginx.yaml
apiversion:
kind: pod
metadata

spec:


There are some examples:
pod v1
Replicationcontroller v1
service v1
Replicateset  apps/v1
Deployment apps/v1
Daemon apps/v1
job batch/v1


#Example
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
    tier: dev
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx


#To get the yaml configration of the pod(which shows the high level details of the pod)
kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o yaml

#To get more details of the pod with the events
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod

#TO check the connectivity from master and pod
from the master IP
ping <POD_IP>

Note: POD ip can be optained from the describe command


#To get inside the pod
kubectl exec -it nginx-pod --/bin/bash
#exit to come out

#To delete the pod
kubectl delete pod nginx-pod
