```
This is where the open-source Istio service mesh comes in. Istio provides 5 traffic management API resources to handle traffic from the edge and also between service subsets:

Virtual services
Destination rules
Gateways
Service entries
Sidecars

Istio uses Envoy proxy as its data plane. Envoy proxy runs as a sidecar container with each application pod and intercepts the traffic going in and out of the pod.
